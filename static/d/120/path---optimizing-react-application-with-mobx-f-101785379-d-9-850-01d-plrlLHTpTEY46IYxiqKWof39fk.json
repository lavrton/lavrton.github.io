The app was not fast, but it was working good enough. Until I click “delete” button of the first caption. I noticed that this operation was VERY slow. It took about <strong>1.5</strong> sec for deleting. This glitch was very noticeable. Why was it slow? After some investigation, I found that React has to rerender ALL captions on delete. You may ask why, if it is just deleting? The thing is — each caption should show its index (see in top left).

It may still look strange why updating of indexes is slow. Even if react didn’t need to touch a lot of elements (pfuuu, just several hundreds), it needs to do a LOT of work under the hood.

This should 100% solve the issue. But, the app has some features about scrolling list in several conditions. To calculate correct scrolling position I needed all elements to be in the DOM (otherwise calculation is too complex). As I have some legacy code, this change may take too long time to implement and test and it may break the app in some cases.</p>\n<p>So I continued to think about a faster solution. In that project, I was using <a href=\"https://mobx.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mobx</a> for state management.

Let us create special component for displaying JUST index:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/react-mobx-perft-3.png\" alt=\"Index code\"></p>\n<p>And then we will use this component inside render of whole item:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/react-mobx-perft-4.png\" alt=\"Index code\"></p>\n<p>What did it change? In this case I am not using “index” property directly inside item render. So when I updated the index this component is not updated (it doesn’t observe that changes).
