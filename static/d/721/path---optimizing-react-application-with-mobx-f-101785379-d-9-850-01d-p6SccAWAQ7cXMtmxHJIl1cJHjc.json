{"data":{"logo":null,"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>From 1.5 sec to 50–100ms (per update)</p>\n<p>There is my short story about how I improved performance of the web-app by 10x with just a simple trick.</p>\n<p>I was building web-based application for a client. It was captions (subtitles) review tool for videos. So you have a video, you have list of subtitles and you want to edit them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/react-mobx-perft-1.png\" alt=\"Captions list\"></p>\n<p>One day I have loaded large projects into the app. The project had several hundreds of captions. The app was not fast, but it was working good enough. Until I click “delete” button of the first caption. I noticed that this operation was VERY slow. It took about <strong>1.5</strong> sec for deleting. This glitch was very noticeable. Why was it slow? After some investigation, I found that React has to rerender ALL captions on delete. You may ask why, if it is just deleting? The thing is — each caption should show its index (see in top left). So when you delete the first caption, indexes of all other captions need to be updated.</p>\n<p>As a proof I deleted the last element, it was very fast. It may still look strange why updating of indexes is slow. Even if react didn’t need to touch a lot of elements (pfuuu, just several hundreds), it needs to do a LOT of work under the hood. It needs to call render for each element, it needs to create a new tree of virtual DOM and it needs to calculate changes and it needs to apply them. This operation tooks long time because one caption component has many elements inside.</p>\n<p>I started to think to use <a href=\"https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">react-virtualized</a> for hiding invisible captions. This should 100% solve the issue. But, the app has some features about scrolling list in several conditions. To calculate correct scrolling position I needed all elements to be in the DOM (otherwise calculation is too complex). As I have some legacy code, this change may take too long time to implement and test and it may break the app in some cases.</p>\n<p>So I continued to think about a faster solution. In that project, I was using <a href=\"https://mobx.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mobx</a> for state management.

Let us create special component for displaying JUST index:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/react-mobx-perft-3.png\" alt=\"Index code\"></p>\n<p>And then we will use this component inside render of whole item:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/react-mobx-perft-4.png\" alt=\"Index code\"></p>\n<p>What did it change? In this case I am not using “index” property directly inside item render. So when I updated the index this component is not updated (it doesn’t observe that changes).
