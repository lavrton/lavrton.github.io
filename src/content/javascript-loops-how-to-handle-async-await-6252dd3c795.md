How to run async loops in sequence or in parallel?

Before doing asynchronous magic with loops I want to remind you how we write classical synchronous loops.

## üòê Synchronous loop
Long time ago I was writing loops like this (probably you too):

```javascript
for (var i=0; i < array.length; i++) {
  var item = array[i];
  // do something with item
}
```

It is good, it is fast, but it has many readability and maintenance issues. Then I used to use its better version:

```javascript
array.forEach((item) => {
  // do something with item
});
```

JavaScript language is developing very fast. We have more features and new syntax. One of my favorite is [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). I am using it more frequently now. And sometimes I have a situation where I need to do something with items in an array asynchronously.

## ü§ó Asynchronous loops

How to use await inside a loop? Let‚Äôs just write async function and await each task.

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  array.forEach(item => {
    // define synchronous anonymous function
    // IT WILL THROW ERROR!
    await func(item);
  })
}
```


This code will **throw a syntax error**. Why? Because we can not use await inside synchronous function. As you can see ‚ÄúprocessArray‚Äù is async function. But anonymous function that we use for forEach is **synchronous**.

### ü§î 1. Don‚Äôt wait for result

How to fix previous issue? We can define anonymous function as asynchronous as well:

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  array.forEach(async (item) => {
    await func(item);
  })
  console.log('Done!');
}
```

But forEach will not wait until all items are finished. It will just run tasks and go next. As a proof let‚Äôs write simple test:

```javascript
function delay() {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));
}

async function delayedLog(item) {
  // notice that we can await a function
  // that returns a promise
  await delay();
  console.log(item);
}
async function processArray(array) {
  array.forEach(async (item) => {
    await delayedLog(item);
  })
  console.log('Done!');
}

processArray([1, 2, 3]);
```

The output will be:

```
Done!
1
2
3
```

It can be ok if you don‚Äôt need to wait for the results. But in almost all cases this is not a good logic.

### üëä 2. Process array in sequence

To wait the result we should return back to old-school ‚Äúfor loop‚Äù, but this time we can use modern version with for..of construction (thanks to [Iteration Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)) for better readability:

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);
  }
  console.log('Done!');
}
```

This will give us expected output:

```
1
2
3
Done!
```

The code will handle each item one by one in series. But we can run it in parallel!

### üí™ 3. Process array in parallel

We can slightly change the code to run async operations in parallel:

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  // map array to promises
  const promises = array.map(delayedLog);
  // wait until all promises are resolved
  await Promise.all(promises);
  console.log('Done!');
}
```

This code will run many `delayLog` tasks in parallel. But be careful with very large array (too many tasks in parallel can be too heavy for CPU or memory).

**Also don't confuse "parallel" here with real threads and paralleling.** That code will not guarantee real parallelism of execution. It depends on your item function (`delayedLog` in this demo). Network requests, webworkers and some other tasks can be executed in parallel.

That is all. Thanks for reading!
